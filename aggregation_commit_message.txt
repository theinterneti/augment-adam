Fix code quality issues in agent coordination aggregation module

This commit addresses several code quality issues in the agent coordination aggregation module:

1. Fixed line length issues in the aggregation.py file
2. Fixed import issues to avoid unused imports
3. Fixed whitespace issues
4. Improved code formatting and readability

These changes are necessary to pass the flake8 checks in the CI pipeline.

Note: Two complexity warnings remain (C901) but these will be addressed in a separate PR.
