# Migration Plan: Dukat to Augment Adam

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the old Dukat project structure to the new Augment Adam structure.

## Directory Structure Migration

### Code Migration

1. **Main Package**:
   - Move `/workspace/augment-adam/augment_adam/**` to `/workspace/augment_adam/`
   - Merge `/workspace/dukat/**` into `/workspace/augment_adam/` (with appropriate refactoring)

2. **Context Engine**:
   - Consolidate `/workspace/context_engine/`, `/workspace/mcp_context_engine/`, and `/workspace/augment-adam/augment_adam/context_engine/` into `/workspace/augment_adam/context_engine/`

### Documentation Migration

1. Move and merge documentation:
   - `/workspace/docs/**` → `/workspace/docs/`
   - `/workspace/augment-adam/docs/**` → `/workspace/docs/`

2. Organize documentation by type:
   - User guides: `/workspace/docs/user_guide/`
   - API reference: `/workspace/docs/api/`
   - Research: `/workspace/docs/research/`
   - Development: `/workspace/docs/development/`

### Test Migration

1. Consolidate all tests:
   - `/workspace/tests/**` → `/workspace/tests/`
   - `/workspace/augment-adam/tests/**` → `/workspace/tests/`

2. Organize tests by type:
   - Unit tests: `/workspace/tests/unit/`
   - Integration tests: `/workspace/tests/integration/`
   - End-to-end tests: `/workspace/tests/e2e/`
   - Performance tests: `/workspace/tests/performance/`
   - Stress tests: `/workspace/tests/stress/`

### Docker and Configuration

1. Move Docker files:
   - `/workspace/Dockerfile.*` → `/workspace/docker/`
   - `/workspace/*docker-compose*.yml` → `/workspace/docker/`

2. Move configuration files:
   - `/workspace/config/**` → `/workspace/config/`
   - `/workspace/neo4j-config/**` → `/workspace/config/neo4j/`
   - `/workspace/redis-config/**` → `/workspace/config/redis/`

### Examples and Scripts

1. Consolidate examples:
   - `/workspace/examples/**` → `/workspace/examples/`
   - `/workspace/augment-adam/examples/**` → `/workspace/examples/`

2. Consolidate scripts:
   - `/workspace/scripts/**` → `/workspace/scripts/`
   - `/workspace/setup_*.sh` → `/workspace/scripts/`

## Code Refactoring

1. Update imports:
   - Change `from dukat import ...` to `from augment_adam import ...`
   - Update relative imports as needed

2. Update configuration:
   - Replace `pyproject.toml` with the new version
   - Remove `setup.py` (using Poetry for package management)

3. Update documentation references:
   - Change all references from "Dukat" to "Augment Adam"
   - Update paths and links in documentation

## Testing Strategy

1. Create a test suite to verify the migration:
   - Test that all modules can be imported
   - Test that all functionality works as expected
   - Test that all examples run correctly

2. Run the test suite before and after migration to ensure no functionality is lost

## Deployment Strategy

1. Create a new branch for the migration
2. Implement the migration in stages
3. Test each stage thoroughly
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Merge the migration branch into the main branch

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Directory structure migration (1-2 days)
2. **Phase 2**: Code refactoring (2-3 days)
3. **Phase 3**: Testing and fixing issues (1-2 days)
4. **Phase 4**: Documentation updates (1 day)
5. **Phase 5**: Final review and deployment (1 day)

Total estimated time: 6-9 days
