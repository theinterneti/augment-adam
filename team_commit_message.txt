Fix code quality issues in agent coordination team module

This commit addresses several code quality issues in the agent coordination team module:

1. Fixed line length issues in the team.py file
2. Fixed import issues to avoid unused imports
3. Improved formatting of error messages
4. Fixed docstring formatting

These changes are necessary to pass the flake8 checks in the CI pipeline.
