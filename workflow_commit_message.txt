Fix code quality issues in agent coordination workflow module

This commit addresses several code quality issues in the agent coordination workflow module:

1. Fixed whitespace issues in the workflow.py file
2. Fixed import issues to avoid unused imports
3. Fixed f-string formatting
4. Added proper blank lines between methods
5. Fixed docstring formatting

These changes are necessary to pass the flake8 checks in the CI pipeline.
