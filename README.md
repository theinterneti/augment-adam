# Augment Adam

An intelligent assistant with advanced memory capabilities.

## Overview

Augment Adam is an AI assistant framework that uses advanced memory systems to provide more contextual and personalized responses. It features a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization.

## Features

- **Advanced Memory Systems**: FAISS-based vector memory for efficient similarity search and Neo4j-based graph memory for complex relationships
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and customize the assistant with plugins
- **Context Engine**: Intelligent context management for better responses
- **Agent Coordination**: Coordinate multiple agents to work together on complex tasks
- **Monte Carlo Techniques**: Apply Monte Carlo techniques to models to enable using smaller models with advanced context/memory techniques
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute tasks in parallel for improved performance

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install augment-adam

# Install with Neo4j support
pip install augment-adam[neo4j]

# Install development dependencies
pip install augment-adam[dev]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from augment_adam.core import Assistant
from augment_adam.memory import FAISSMemory

# Create a memory system
memory = FAISSMemory()

# Create an assistant
assistant = Assistant(memory=memory)

# Chat with the assistant
response = assistant.chat("Hello, how can you help me?")
print(response)
```
