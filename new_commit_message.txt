Fix code quality issues and update documentation

This commit addresses several issues:

1. Fixed code quality issues flagged by CI checks
2. Updated documentation to match the current codebase structure
3. Added missing team.py and workflow.py files for agent coordination
4. Fixed Docker configuration files
5. Updated GitHub workflow configuration files

These changes are necessary to pass the CI checks and ensure the project
meets the required standards before merging into main.
