Fix code quality issues in tagging system

This commit addresses several code quality issues in the tagging system:

1. Fixed line length issues in the core.py file
2. Fixed import issues to avoid duplicate imports
3. Removed unused imports
4. Fixed docstring formatting

These changes are necessary to pass the flake8 checks in the CI pipeline.
