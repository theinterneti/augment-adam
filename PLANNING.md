# Project Planning Document

## Current Status

We have completed a comprehensive assessment of 10 leading open-source AI projects identified in the GitHub blog article "From MCP to multi-agents: The top 10 open source AI projects on GitHub right now and why they matter." Each project has been evaluated for its potential relevance to our development efforts.

## Research Completed

1. **Open Source AI Project Assessments**: Detailed evaluations of 10 projects covering:
   - Project overview and core functionality
   - Technical architecture
   - Compatibility with our goals
   - Integration potential
   - Unique value propositions
   - Limitations and considerations
   - Community and support status
   - Recommendations for our project

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Created an index document that provides a side-by-side comparison of all projects, highlighting key strengths, limitations, and compatibility with our goals.

3. **Documentation Structure**: Organized all research in the `docs/research/open-source-ai-projects/` directory with:
   - Individual assessment files for each project
   - An index file for comparative analysis
   - A README explaining the assessment criteria and structure

## Key Findings

1. **MCP is Becoming a Standard**: Multiple projects are adopting the Model Context Protocol as the primary method for connecting AI models with external tools.

2. **Shift from Models to Agents**: The focus in AI development has shifted from model creation to agent capabilities, with emphasis on how agents can use tools, maintain context, and collaborate.

3. **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Projects like OWL demonstrate the growing importance of orchestrating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks.

4. **Modular AI Architecture**: There's a trend toward modular, composable AI systems where specialized components handle different aspects of perception, memory, reasoning, and action.

5. **Speech Synthesis Advancement**: Speech synthesis is advancing beyond basic text-to-speech to include natural intonation, precise timing control, and conversational capabilities.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

Based on our research, we recommend the following actions:

1. **Evaluate MCP Integration Options**:
   - Set up a proof-of-concept using Open WebUI MCP to bridge our existing REST APIs with MCP tools
   - Add F/mcptools to our development toolkit for testing and debugging MCP implementations

2. **Explore Agent Architecture**:
   - Investigate OWL's multi-agent framework for complex workflows
   - Adopt Letta's agent file format for serializing and persisting agent state

3. **Monitor Emerging Projects**:
   - Track Unbody's development as a potential foundation for our AI-native backend
   - Follow Second-Me for insights on personalization approaches

4. **Consider Speech Capabilities**:
   - Evaluate VoiceStar and CSM for potential audio features requiring natural speech

5. **Update Architecture Documentation**:
   - Revise our architecture documents to incorporate insights from this research
   - Create a decision matrix for build vs. integrate choices based on our findings

## Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Set up proof-of-concept integrations with Open WebUI MCP and F/mcptools
2. **Week 3-4**: Evaluate OWL and Letta agent file for agent architecture
3. **Week 5-6**: Update architecture documentation with research findings
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor development of emerging projects identified in our research

## Resources Required

1. **Development Environment**: Ensure Docker and necessary dependencies are set up for testing these projects
2. **Documentation**: Update our internal knowledge base with findings from this research
3. **Team Training**: Schedule knowledge-sharing sessions on MCP and agent architecture concepts

## Conclusion

This research has provided valuable insights into the current state of open-source AI development and identified several promising technologies that align with our project goals. By strategically adopting or drawing inspiration from these projects, we can accelerate our development while leveraging the collective innovation of the open-source community.
