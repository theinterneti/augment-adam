# Dukat Development Plan v0.3.2 (2025-04-26)

## Vision

Dukat will be an open-source AI assistant focused on personal automation, built entirely with open-source models and packages. It will prioritize high-quality code through automated documentation, testing, and continuous self-improvement.

## Core Principles

1. **Open Source Only**: All components, models, and dependencies will be open source
2. **Local-First**: Designed to run entirely locally without external API dependencies
3. **Self-Improving**: Implements mechanisms to learn from interactions and improve over time
4. **Quality-Focused**: Emphasizes automated testing, documentation, and code quality
5. **Asynchronous**: Leverages async processing for responsive performance
6. **Modular**: Built with a plugin architecture for extensibility

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework

- **DSPy**: Primary framework for LLM programming and optimization
- **Ollama**: Local model hosting and inference
- **ChromaDB/FAISS**: Vector storage for knowledge and memory

### Development Tools

- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Sphinx**: Documentation generation
- **Black/Ruff**: Code formatting and linting
- **Mypy**: Static type checking
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks

### User Interface

- **Gradio/Streamlit**: Web interface (Phase 2)
- **Rich**: Terminal UI for CLI

## Architecture

### 1. Core System

- **Model Manager**: Handles model loading, inference, and optimization
- **Memory System**: Manages short-term and long-term memory
- **Tool Registry**: Manages available tools and their capabilities
- **Prompt Manager**: Handles prompt templates and optimization

### 2. Plugin System

- **Tool Interface**: Standard interface for all tools
- **Plugin Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of plugins
- **Permission System**: Manages tool access and permissions

### 3. Memory Architecture

- **Working Memory**: Short-term context for conversations
- **Episodic Memory**: Record of past interactions and outcomes
- **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge extracted from interactions
- **Procedural Memory**: Learned patterns and procedures

### 4. Self-Improvement Mechanisms

- **Feedback Loop**: Collects and processes user feedback
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks system performance metrics
- **Prompt Optimization**: Uses DSPy to optimize prompts based on outcomes
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge between models
