# Dukat Development Plan v0.3.3 (2025-04-27)

## Vision

Dukat is an open-source AI coding agent focused on development automation, built entirely with open-source models and packages. It prioritizes high-quality code through automated documentation, testing, and code generation, all while running locally for privacy and control.

## Core Principles

1. **Open Source Only**: All components, models, and dependencies will be open source
2. **Local-First**: Designed to run entirely locally without external API dependencies
3. **Self-Improving**: Implements mechanisms to learn from interactions and improve over time
4. **Quality-Focused**: Emphasizes automated testing, documentation, and code quality
5. **Asynchronous**: Leverages async processing for responsive performance
6. **Modular**: Built with a plugin architecture for extensibility

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Primary framework for model loading and inference
- **Accelerate/BitsAndBytes**: Model optimization and quantization
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model execution
- **ChromaDB/FAISS**: Vector storage for code context and knowledge

### Development Tools

- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Sphinx**: Documentation generation
- **Black/Ruff**: Code formatting and linting
- **Mypy**: Static type checking
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks

### User Interface

- **Gradio/Streamlit**: Web interface (Phase 2)
- **Rich**: Terminal UI for CLI

## Architecture

### 1. Core System

- **Model Manager**: Handles model downloading, loading, and inference
- **Prompt Templates**: Specialized templates for code-related tasks
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tools for all features
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing for all components

### 2. Development Integration

- **Git Integration**: Hooks and automation for version control
- **IDE Extensions**: Integration with popular development environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated code quality in continuous integration

### 3. Code Generation Capabilities

- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic creation of docstrings and comments
- **Test Generation**: Creation of comprehensive test cases
- **Code Review**: Automated code quality assessment
- **Refactoring**: Suggestions for code improvements

### 4. Advanced Features

- **Project Context Understanding**: Comprehension of entire codebases
- **Multi-File Operations**: Cross-file refactoring and generation
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Customization for specific projects or languages
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user support and shared knowledge
