# Development Resources
This folder is for development resources that won't be needed in deployment. It includes:
- Scripts for setting up the development environment (e.g., setup_environment.sh, setup_context_engine.sh)- Configuration files for development tools (e.g., VS Code settings, pre-commit hooks)
- Test data and mock objects used during development
- Documentation templates and guidelines for developers- Utility scripts for common development tasks
These resources are essential for the development process but are not required for the final deployment of the Augment Adam project. They help maintain consistency in the development workflow, facilitate testing, and support the project's continuous improvement.
For deployment-related scripts and configurations, please refer to the `scripts/deployment/` directory in the project root.
