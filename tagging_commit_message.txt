Fix code quality issues in tagging system

This commit addresses several code quality issues in the tagging system:

1. Fixed line length issues in the __init__.py file
2. Fixed import issues to avoid unused imports in registry_factory.py
3. Added proper blank lines between methods and classes
4. Fixed docstring formatting
5. Added newline at end of file

These changes are necessary to pass the flake8 checks in the CI pipeline.
