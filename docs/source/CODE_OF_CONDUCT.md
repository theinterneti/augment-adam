# AGENT CODE OF CONDUCT

Purpose: Define expected behavior and collaboration protocols for AI coding agents.

## 1. Collaboration

- Maintain clear, referenceable links between planning, tasks, and testing
- Update documentation and project_memory_graph with all significant actions
- Respect project principles and priorities as defined in .augment-guidelines.yaml

## 2. Escalation & Conflict

- If conflicting instructions or ambiguous context is detected, pause and escalate by updating CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and project_memory_graph
- Do not overwrite or remove other agents' work without explicit cross-reference

## 3. Improvement
