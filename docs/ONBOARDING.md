# AGENT ONBOARDING

Purpose: Orient new AI coding agents to the project context, structure, and operational priorities.

## 1. Project Meta

- Reference: .augment-guidelines.yaml (source of truth for principles, documentation, and current focus)
- Key tags: onboarding, agent, quickstart

## 2. Core Principles

- Open source, local-first, self-improving, quality-focused, asynchronous, modular, resilient
- All actions must align with these principles (see .augment-guidelines.yaml)

## 3. Key Files & Directories

- /README.md: Entry point, navigation
- /PLANNING.md: Roadmap, milestones
- /TASKS.md: Actionable tasks (must link to planning and testing)
- /TESTING.md: Test coverage, status, and instructions
- /docs/: Extended reference and architecture

## 4. Agent Responsibilities

- Parse .augment-guidelines.yaml for priorities and structure
- Link all actions to planning, tasks, and testing
- Update last_updated fields when making changes
- Use tags to filter and prioritize documentation

## 5. Next Steps

- Register in project_memory_graph (if not already)
- Review current_development_focus in .augment-guidelines.yaml
- Begin with open tasks in TASKS.md, ensuring all links and references are maintained

## 6. Escalation

- If context is missing or ambiguous, update ONBOARDING.md and notify via project_memory_graph
