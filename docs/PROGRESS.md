# Dukat Project Progress Report

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the Dukat project, an open-source AI assistant built using only open-source models and packages for personal automation.

## Current Status

As of April 22, 2025, we have implemented the core components of the Dukat assistant and have achieved a test coverage of 67%. The project is structured around a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization.

### Implemented Components

1. **Memory System**:
   - Working Memory: Manages conversation context and history
   - Episodic Memory: Stores and retrieves past interactions
   - Semantic Memory: Manages knowledge and concepts

2. **Model Management**:
   - Support for multiple model providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Module creation and optimization using DSPy
   - Response generation and formatting

3. **Prompt Management**:
   - Template creation and management
   - Variable substitution
   - DSPy module integration

4. **Plugin System**:
   - File Manager: File operations and management
   - Web Search: Search engines and web page fetching
   - System Info: System resource monitoring

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage is at 67%, with 101 passing tests and 8 failing tests. The failing tests are primarily related to:

1. String formatting in Episode.__str__
2. YAML file handling in FileManagerPlugin
3. Directory listing in FileManagerPlugin
4. Concept retrieval in SemanticMemory
5. CPU information in SystemInfoPlugin
6. URL encoding in WebSearchPlugin

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Failing Tests**:
   - Address the 8 failing tests to achieve higher test coverage
   - Ensure compatibility with the latest libraries

2. **Complete Memory Integration**:
   - Implement ProcedualMemory for learned patterns
   - Create memory integration with Assistant
   - Add memory persistence and recovery
   - Implement memory optimization and pruning

3. **Enhance Plugin System**:
   - Create CalendarPlugin for calendar operations
   - Develop NotesPlugin for note-taking
   - Add plugin discovery and loading
   - Implement plugin permissions system

4. **Improve CLI Interface**:
   - Implement interactive conversation mode
   - Add command history and editing
   - Create progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Implement syntax highlighting for code

5. **Implement Async Processing**:
   - Create task queue for background processing
   - Implement non-blocking operations
   - Develop progress reporting
   - Add task cancellation and pausing

6. **Add Web Interface**:
   - Create basic web UI with Gradio
   - Implement conversation history display
   - Add file upload and download
   - Develop tool integration in UI

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Library Compatibility**:
   - Challenge: Some libraries (like ChromaDB) are not compatible with the latest versions of dependencies (like NumPy 2.0)
   - Solution: Added compatibility layers to ensure the code works with the latest libraries

2. **DSPy Integration**:
   - Challenge: DSPy API changes between versions
   - Solution: Created a flexible model manager that can adapt to different DSPy versions

3. **Testing Complexity**:
   - Challenge: Testing components that interact with external services
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive mocking to isolate components during testing

## Conclusion

The Dukat project is making good progress towards creating a fully open-source AI assistant. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization, and the focus on testing ensures reliability. The next steps will focus on fixing the remaining test failures, completing the memory integration, and enhancing the plugin system.
