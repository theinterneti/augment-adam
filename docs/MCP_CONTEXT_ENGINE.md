# MCP-Enabled Context Engine

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a high-performance context engine that exposes its capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The context engine combines Redis for real-time vector search and Neo4j for graph relationships, providing a powerful system for code context retrieval and knowledge graph navigation.

## Architecture

The context engine uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Redis with Vector Search**: For high-speed real-time vector similarity searches
2. **Neo4j with Vector Capabilities**: For graph relationships and background processing
3. **Tiered Memory Architecture**: To balance performance and resource usage
4. **Asynchronous Processing Framework**: For handling background tasks
5. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: For standardized tool access

## MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with tools and services. By integrating MCP with our context engine, we enable AI models to:

1. Search for similar code snippets
2. Store and retrieve vectors
3. Create and navigate relationships in the knowledge graph
4. Index code repositories

### MCP Server Implementation

We use FastAPI-MCP to expose our context engine's capabilities as MCP tools. This approach:

1. Preserves the schemas and documentation of our API endpoints
2. Provides a standardized interface for AI models
3. Enables authentication and authorization
4. Allows for flexible deployment options

## Components

### 1. Redis Vector Database

Redis is used for high-performance vector similarity search:

- **HNSW Algorithm**: Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent search capabilities
- **Tiered Storage**: Hot, warm, and cold tiers for optimal performance

### 2. Neo4j Graph Database

Neo4j is used for storing and navigating relationships:

- **Vector Indexes**: Efficient similarity search
- **Graph Relationships**: Rich context through relationship traversal
- **Hybrid Queries**: Combine vector similarity with graph structure

### 3. FastAPI MCP Server

The FastAPI MCP server exposes the context engine's capabilities:

- **Vector Search Tool**: Search for similar vectors
- **Vector Store Tool**: Store vectors in the database
- **Code Index Tool**: Index code in the database
- **Knowledge Graph Tools**: Create and navigate relationships

### 4. Background Worker

The background worker handles resource-intensive tasks:

- **Code Indexing**: Process and index code repositories
- **Knowledge Graph Updates**: Update relationships based on new information
- **Vector Synchronization**: Sync vectors between Redis and Neo4j
- **Vector Pruning**: Remove old or unused vectors

## API Endpoints

The context engine exposes the following API endpoints:

1. **Vector Search**: `/api/vector/search`
2. **Vector Store**: `/api/vector/store`
3. **Code Index**: `/api/code/index`
4. **Create Relationship**: `/api/graph/relationship`
5. **Get Related Vectors**: `/api/graph/related`

These endpoints are also exposed as MCP tools through the MCP server.

## MCP Tools

The context engine exposes the following MCP tools:

1. **vector_search**: Search for vectors similar to a query text
2. **vector_store**: Store a vector in the database
3. **code_index**: Index code in the database
4. **create_relationship**: Create a relationship between two vectors
5. **get_related_vectors**: Get vectors related to a vector

## Performance Considerations

The context engine is designed for high performance:

- **Redis Configuration**: Optimized for vector search performance
- **Neo4j Configuration**: Optimized for graph operations
- **Tiered Memory**: Balance between performance and resource usage
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle resource-intensive tasks in the background

## Security Considerations

The context engine implements several security measures:

- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication for API access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the API
- **Input Validation**: Validate all input to prevent injection attacks

## Deployment

The context engine can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Docker Compose**: For local development and testing
2. **Kubernetes**: For production deployment
3. **Separate Services**: Deploy components separately for scalability

## Integration with AI Models

The context engine can be integrated with AI models that support the MCP standard:

- **LangChain**: Use the MCP tools with LangChain agents
- **LlamaIndex**: Use the MCP tools with LlamaIndex agents
- **Custom Agents**: Use the MCP tools with custom agents

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements:

- **Distributed Deployment**: Scale across multiple nodes for larger codebases
- **Advanced Caching**: More sophisticated caching strategies
- **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune embedding models for specific codebases
- **Semantic Understanding**: Deeper semantic understanding of code
- **Tool Catalog**: Dynamic selection of MCP tools based on context
