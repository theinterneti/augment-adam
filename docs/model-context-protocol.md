# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts like a "USB-C port for AI applications," providing a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

MCP helps build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs by providing:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that LLMs can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing data within your infrastructure

## Augment-Adam as an MCP Expert

Augment-Adam serves as an expert on all aspects of the Model Context Protocol, including:

1. **MCP Client Integration**: Configuring and using MCP clients like Claude Desktop, VS Code, and custom implementations
2. **MCP Server Development**: Building custom MCP servers to expose specific functionality
3. **MCP Server Containerization**: Packaging MCP servers in Docker containers for easy deployment
4. **MCP Ecosystem Monitoring**: Tracking new developments, servers, and best practices in the MCP ecosystem

## Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

## Docker MCP Server

The Docker MCP server provides a collection of tools that can be accessed through the Model Context Protocol. These tools are organized into several categories:

### Knowledge Graph Tools

- **create_entities**: Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph
- **create_relations**: Create multiple new relations between entities in the knowledge graph
- **add_observations**: Add new observations to existing entities in the knowledge graph
- **delete_entities**: Delete multiple entities and their associated relations from the knowledge graph
- **delete_observations**: Delete specific observations from entities in the knowledge graph
- **delete_relations**: Delete multiple relations from the knowledge graph
- **read_graph**: Read the entire knowledge graph
- **search_nodes**: Search for nodes in the knowledge graph based on a query
- **open_nodes**: Open specific nodes in the knowledge graph by their names

### GitHub Integration Tools

- **create_or_update_file**: Create or update a single file in a GitHub repository
- **search_repositories**: Search for GitHub repositories
- **create_repository**: Create a new GitHub repository in your account
- **get_file_contents**: Get the contents of a file or directory from a GitHub repository
- **push_files**: Push multiple files to a GitHub repository in a single commit
- **create_issue**: Create a new issue in a GitHub repository
- **create_pull_request**: Create a new pull request in a GitHub repository
- **fork_repository**: Fork a GitHub repository to your account or specified organization
- **create_branch**: Create a new branch in a GitHub repository
- **list_commits**: Get list of commits of a branch in a GitHub repository
- **list_issues**: List issues in a GitHub repository with filtering options
- **update_issue**: Update an existing issue in a GitHub repository
- **add_issue_comment**: Add a comment to an existing issue
- **search_code**: Search for code across GitHub repositories
- **search_issues**: Search for issues and pull requests across GitHub repositories
- **search_users**: Search for users on GitHub
- **get_issue**: Get details of a specific issue in a GitHub repository

### Docker CLI Tool

- **docker**: Use the Docker CLI through the MCP server

### Tool Registration

- **tool-registration**: Bootstrap a tool definition in the current session

## Using MCP in Your Project

To use MCP in your project, you need to:

1. Set up an MCP server that provides the tools you need
2. Configure an MCP client to connect to the server
3. Use the tools provided by the server in your application

### Example Configuration for Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-it",
        "docker-mcp-server",
        "/usr/local/bin/mcp-connect.sh"
      ]
    },
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "<YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Configuration for VS Code

VS Code also supports MCP servers through its GitHub Copilot integration:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building and Containerizing MCP Servers

Augment-Adam can help build and containerize custom MCP servers:

1. **Server Development**:

   - Create custom MCP servers using TypeScript or Python SDKs
   - Implement specific tools and resources needed for your project
   - Test servers locally before containerization

2. **Containerization**:

   - Package MCP servers in Docker containers
   - Create Dockerfiles optimized for MCP server deployment
   - Configure container networking for MCP communication

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy containerized MCP servers to various environments
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for MCP server updates
   - Monitor and maintain deployed MCP servers

## Benefits for Our Project

Integrating MCP into our project provides several benefits:

1. **Standardized Tool Access**: Provides a consistent way for AI models to access various tools and data sources
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities as needed
3. **Security**: Helps maintain security by controlling what data and tools the AI model can access
4. **Interoperability**: Works with different AI models and platforms
5. **Community Support**: Large and growing ecosystem of tools and servers
6. **Rapid Development**: Leverage existing MCP servers to quickly add functionality
7. **Future-Proofing**: Adopt an emerging standard that's gaining widespread support

## Staying Current with MCP Developments

The MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving. Augment-Adam maintains awareness of:
