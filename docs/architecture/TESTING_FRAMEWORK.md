# Testing Framework Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Testing Framework in Augment Adam. The Testing Framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for testing the various components of the system, ensuring reliability and correctness.



## Components

### Test Runners

Test Runners are responsible for executing tests and reporting results. They provide a consistent interface for running different types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

#### UnitTestRunner

Executes unit tests for individual components.

#### IntegrationTestRunner

Executes integration tests that verify the interactions between components.

#### SystemTestRunner

Executes end-to-end tests that verify the behavior of the entire system.

#### PerformanceTestRunner

Executes performance tests that measure the performance of components and the system.

### Mock Components

Mock Components provide simplified implementations of system components for use in testing. They implement the same interfaces as the real components, but with behavior that is suitable for testing.

#### MockMemory

A mock implementation of the Memory component.

#### MockContextEngine

A mock implementation of the Context Engine component.

#### MockAgent

A mock implementation of the Agent component.

#### MockModel

A mock implementation of the Model component.

### Test Environments

Test Environments provide a controlled environment for running tests. They manage the lifecycle of test components and provide utilities for configuring and interacting with them.

#### TestEnvironment

A general-purpose test environment for integration testing.

#### SystemTestEnvironment

A specialized test environment for end-to-end testing of the entire system.

#### PerformanceTestEnvironment

A specialized test environment for performance testing.

### Test Data Generators

Test Data Generators provide utilities for generating test data for various components. They make it easy to create realistic test data for testing different scenarios.

#### TextGenerator

Generates random text for testing text-based components.

    def setUp(self):
        self.memory = MockMemory()
        
    def test_add_and_retrieve(self):
        # Add an item to memory
        item_id = self.memory.add("Hello, world!", {"source": "test"})
        
        # Retrieve the item
        item = self.memory.get(item_id)
        
        # Assert that the item was retrieved correctly
        self.assertEqual(item["text"], "Hello, world!")
        self.assertEqual(item["metadata"]["source"], "test")
        
    def test_search(self):
        # Add items to memory
        self.memory.add("Hello, world!", {"source": "test"})
        self.memory.add("Goodbye, world!", {"source": "test"})
        
        # Search for items
        results = self.memory.search("Hello", k=1)
        
        # Assert that the search returned the correct item
        self.assertEqual(len(results), 1)
        self.assertEqual(results[0]["text"], "Hello, world!")
        
    def test_delete(self):

        self.memory = MockMemory()
        self.context_engine = MockContextEngine(memory=self.memory)
        self.env.register_component("memory", self.memory)
        self.env.register_component("context_engine", self.context_engine)
        
    def test_context_retrieval(self):
        # Add items to memory
        self.memory.add("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", {"source": "test", "type": "document"})
        self.memory.add("The five boxing wizards jump quickly.", {"source": "test", "type": "document"})
        
        # Retrieve context using the context engine

        # Assert that the context contains the correct item
        self.assertEqual(len(context), 1)
        self.assertIn("quick brown fox", context[0]["text"])
        
    def tearDown(self):
