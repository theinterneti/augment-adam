What can I do with Augment Adam?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Augment Adam to:

- Build AI assistants with memory
- Create context-aware applications
- Develop plugins to extend functionality
- Implement custom templates for output formatting

What are the system requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Augment Adam requires:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB of RAM or more
- 1GB of disk space or more

Is Augment Adam open source?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, Augment Adam is open source and available under the MIT license.

Memory System Questions
-----------------------

What types of memory does Augment Adam support?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Augment Adam supports several types of memory:

- Vector Memory: Stores and retrieves information using vector embeddings
- Keyword Memory: Stores and retrieves information using keyword matching
- Hybrid Memory: Combines multiple memory types
- Episodic Memory: Stores and retrieves episodic information
- Semantic Memory: Stores and retrieves semantic information
- Working Memory: Stores and retrieves working memory information

How does Vector Memory work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vector Memory works by:

1. Converting text to vector embeddings
2. Storing the embeddings in a vector database
3. Searching for similar embeddings when queried
4. Returning the most similar results

Can I use my own embedding model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, you can use your own embedding model by implementing the EmbeddingModel interface.

How do I persist memory to disk?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can persist memory to disk by:

1. Initializing memory with a persistence path
2. Calling the save() method to save memory
3. Calling the load() method to load memory

Context Engine Questions
------------------------

What is the Context Engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Context Engine is responsible for retrieving relevant context for the assistant based on the user's query.

How does the Context Engine work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Context Engine works by:

1. Analyzing the user's query
2. Retrieving relevant information from memory
3. Filtering and ranking the results
4. Formatting the context for the assistant

Can I use multiple memory sources with the Context Engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, you can use multiple memory sources with the Context Engine by providing a list of memory sources and optional weights.

Agent Questions
---------------

What is an Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Agent is a high-level interface for creating and running AI assistants.

How does an Agent work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Agent works by:

1. Receiving a query from the user
2. Retrieving relevant context using the Context Engine
3. Generating a response using a language model
4. Returning the response to the user

Can Agents use tools?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, Agents can use tools by registering them with a ToolRegistry and providing the registry to the Agent.

Plugin Questions
----------------

What is a Plugin?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Plugin is a way to extend the functionality of Augment Adam.

How do I create a Plugin?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a Plugin by:

1. Implementing the Plugin interface
2. Registering the plugin with a PluginRegistry
3. Using the plugin through the registry

Can Plugins depend on other Plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, Plugins can depend on other Plugins by specifying dependencies and implementing the set_dependencies method.

Template Questions
------------------

What is a Template?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Template is a way to format output from Augment Adam.

How do I create a Template?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a Template by:

1. Implementing the Template interface
2. Registering the template with a TemplateEngine
3. Using the template through the engine

Can I use Jinja2 templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, Augment Adam supports Jinja2 templates through the Jinja2TemplateEngine.

Troubleshooting
---------------

I'm getting an error when installing Augment Adam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed and try installing with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install augment-adam

My memory search returns no results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that:

1. You've added data to memory
2. Your search query is relevant to the data
3. Your similarity threshold is not too high

My agent doesn't use the right context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that:

1. Your memory contains the relevant information
2. Your context engine is configured correctly
3. Your agent is using the context engine

My plugin doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that:

1. Your plugin is registered with the registry
2. Your plugin dependencies are satisfied
3. You're calling the plugin methods correctly
