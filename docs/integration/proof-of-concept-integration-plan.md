# Proof-of-Concept Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for creating proof-of-concept integrations with selected open-source AI projects.

**Timeline:** 2 weeks

## Resource Requirements

| Resource | Description | Quantity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Developer Time | Engineers for implementation | 2 FTE |
| Testing Resources | QA engineers for validation | 1 FTE |
| Hardware | GPU for speech synthesis testing | 1 |
| Cloud Resources | Additional compute for testing | As needed |
| External Expertise | Consultation on MCP integration | As needed |

## Evaluation Process

Each integration will follow this evaluation process:

1. **Initial Setup:** Configure and deploy the integration in a development environment
2. **Functional Testing:** Verify that all required functionality works as expected
3. **Performance Testing:** Measure performance metrics against our requirements
4. **Security Review:** Assess security implications and mitigate any risks
5. **Developer Experience:** Gather feedback from developers on usability
6. **Go/No-Go Decision:** Determine whether to proceed with full integration

## Documentation Requirements

For each integration, we will produce:

1. **Setup Guide:** Detailed instructions for configuring the integration
2. **API Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of all interfaces
3. **Usage Examples:** Code samples demonstrating common use cases
4. **Troubleshooting Guide:** Solutions for common issues
5. **Architecture Update:** Updates to our architecture documentation

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment for Phase 1 integrations
2. Create detailed technical specifications for Open WebUI MCP integration
3. Schedule kickoff meeting with development team
4. Procure necessary resources for implementation
5. Establish regular check-in schedule for progress updates
