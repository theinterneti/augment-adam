### Scoring Guide

For each criterion, assign a score from 1-5:
- 5: Excellent - Exceeds requirements with significant advantages
- 4: Good - Fully meets requirements with some advantages
- 3: Acceptable - Meets minimum requirements
- 2: Poor - Falls short of requirements but workable
- 1: Unacceptable - Fails to meet requirements

Multiply each score by the weight to get a weighted score, then sum all weighted scores for the total.
