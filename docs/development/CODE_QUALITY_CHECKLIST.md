## Automated Checklist Application

To automatically apply this checklist to your code, run:

```bash
python scripts/code_quality_checker.py --file path/to/your/file.py
```

This will generate a report showing which checklist items pass and which need attention.

## Test Generation

Once your code passes the checklist, you can generate tests using:

```bash
python scripts/generate_tests.py --file path/to/your/file.py
```

This will create test files based on the code's functionality and the checklist requirements.
