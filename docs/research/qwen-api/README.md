# Qwen API Research for VSCode Extension

## Overview

This directory contains research on the Qwen API capabilities and how we can leverage them for our VSCode extension. The focus is on understanding Qwen 3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture and how it can be used to implement an efficient hierarchical agent system for DevOps guidance.

## Key Findings

1. **Qwen 3 MoE Architecture**
   - Qwen3-30B-A3B: 30B total parameters, 3B activated (10%)
   - Qwen3-235B-A22B: 235B total parameters, 22B activated (~9.4%)
   - Activates only a subset of parameters during inference
   - Achieves performance comparable to much larger dense models

2. **Hybrid Thinking Modes**
   - Thinking mode: Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
   - Non-thinking mode: Quick responses for simpler questions
   - Dynamic control via `/think` and `/no_think` directives
   - Enables efficient allocation of computational resources

3. **Qwen-Agent Framework**
   - Native support for function calling and tool use
   - MCP integration for containerized tools
   - Agent components for conversation, reasoning, and tool execution
   - Flexible architecture for custom agent implementation

4. **MCP Tool Containerization**
   - Docker containers for isolated, consistent tool environments
   - Dynamic instantiation and resource management
   - Integration with VSCode extension via Container Manager
   - Seamless interaction with Qwen-Agent

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**
   - Use Qwen3-30B-A3B as the primary model for the agent system
   - Consider smaller models (Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-4B) for specific agents
   - Match model size and thinking mode to task complexity

2. **Agent Architecture**
   - Implement a hierarchical system with coordinator and specialized agents
   - Use thinking mode for complex planning and reasoning
   - Use non-thinking mode for routine, well-defined tasks
   - Implement resource-aware scheduling for efficient execution

3. **Tool Integration**
   - Containerize core DevOps tools using MCP protocol
   - Implement Container Manager for dynamic instantiation
   - Use Qwen-Agent for seamless tool integration
   - Provide consistent interface for all tools

4. **VSCode Extension Integration**
   - Create a WebSocket server for communication
   - Implement extension commands for different DevOps tasks
   - Manage agent lifecycle and resource allocation
   - Provide intuitive UI for interaction with the agent system

## Next Steps

1. Set up a containerized development environment with Qwen models
2. Implement the agent coordinator with task decomposition capabilities
3. Create specialized agents for different DevOps roles
4. Develop the container management system for MCP tools
5. Build the user interface for seamless interaction with the agent system
