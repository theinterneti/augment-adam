# MCP and Qwen Integration

## Overview

This document explores the integration between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Qwen 3, focusing on how to leverage MCP servers with Qwen's capabilities. The goal is to identify the most effective approaches for integrating MCP servers with Qwen 3 in our VS Code extension.

## Qwen 3 Capabilities

Qwen 3 introduces several capabilities that make it well-suited for integration with MCP servers:

### 1. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture

Qwen 3 includes MoE models that provide significant efficiency advantages:

- **Qwen3-30B-A3B**: 30 billion total parameters with 3 billion activated parameters
- **Qwen3-235B-A22B**: 235 billion total parameters with 22 billion activated parameters
- Only activates ~10% of parameters during inference
- Achieves performance comparable to much larger dense models
- Reduces computational costs while maintaining high capability

This architecture allows for efficient resource allocation, making it ideal for running multiple MCP servers simultaneously.

### 2. Hybrid Thinking Modes

Qwen 3 supports two distinct thinking modes:

- **Thinking Mode**: Step-by-step reasoning before delivering final answers
- **Non-Thinking Mode**: Quick, near-instant responses

This hybrid approach allows for dynamic allocation of computational resources based on task complexity, which is ideal for our hierarchical agent system where different agents may require different levels of reasoning.

### 3. Function Calling Capabilities

Qwen 3 provides robust function calling capabilities:

- JSON Schema-based function descriptions
- Structured function call parsing
- Support for parallel function calls
- Error handling and recovery

These capabilities align well with MCP's tool-based approach, making integration straightforward.

## Qwen-Agent Framework

The [Qwen-Agent framework](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) provides native support for MCP, offering:

### 1. Tool Integration

- Built-in support for function calling
- Custom tool registration via Python decorators
- MCP integration for containerized tools

### 2. Agent Components

- LLM interfaces for various deployment options
- Prompt templates optimized for agent interactions
- Memory systems for conversation history
- Tool execution and result handling

### 3. High-Level Agent Types

- Assistant: General-purpose conversational agent
- ReAct Chat: Agent with reasoning and action capabilities
- Custom agents with specialized behaviors

## Integration Approaches

Based on our research, we've identified three main approaches for integrating MCP servers with Qwen 3:

### 1. Direct API Integration

This approach involves directly integrating Qwen 3 with MCP servers using the Qwen API:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)

# Switch between thinking and non-thinking modes
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=True  # or False for non-thinking mode
)
```

**Advantages**:
- Full control over the Qwen model
- Direct access to model parameters and configurations
- Ability to fine-tune the model for specific tasks

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires significant computational resources
- More complex implementation
- Requires managing model deployment

### 2. OpenAI-Compatible API Server

This approach involves deploying Qwen 3 as an OpenAI-compatible API server:

```bash
# Using SGLang
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --reasoning-parser qwen3

# Using vLLM
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1
```

Then, using the standard OpenAI client libraries to interact with the server:

```python
import openai

client = openai.Client(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen3-30B-A3B",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}
    ],
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "description": "Get the current weather",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "location": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["location"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

**Advantages**:
- Compatibility with existing OpenAI-based integrations
- Familiar API for developers
- Easier integration with existing tools

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited access to Qwen-specific features
- Potential compatibility issues with advanced features
- Additional deployment complexity

### 3. Qwen-Agent Integration

This approach involves using the Qwen-Agent framework to integrate with MCP servers:

```python
from qwen_agent.agents import Assistant
from qwen_agent.llm import get_chat_model

# Define LLM configuration
llm_cfg = {
    'model': 'Qwen3-30B-A3B',
    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',
    'api_key': 'EMPTY',
}

# Define tools (including containerized MCP tools)
tools = [
    {'mcpServers': {
        'docker_tool': {
            'command': 'uvx',
            'args': ['mcp-server-docker']
        },
        'github_tool': {
            'command': 'uvx',
            'args': ['mcp-server-github']
        }
    }},
    'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tool
]

# Create agent
agent = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)
```

**Advantages**:
