# MCP Servers Research

## Overview

This directory contains research on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and their integration with Qwen 3 for our VS Code extension. The research aims to identify the most useful MCP servers, understand best practices for MCP server management, and evaluate how these servers can be leveraged with Qwen 3.

## Contents

1. [MCP Servers Overview](mcp_servers_overview.md) - A comprehensive analysis of the official MCP servers repository and its ecosystem
2. [MCP and Qwen Integration](mcp_qwen_integration.md) - Exploration of the integration between MCP and Qwen 3
3. [Implementation Strategy](implementation_strategy.md) - Detailed implementation strategy for enhancing our VS Code extension

## Key Findings

### MCP Servers Ecosystem

- The official [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) contains numerous reference implementations and community-built servers
- MCP servers are implemented using either the TypeScript SDK or Python SDK
- Most servers are designed to be containerized for isolation and portability
- The ecosystem includes tools for server discovery, installation, and management

### Key MCP Servers for Our Extension

1. **GitHub MCP Server** - For repository management, PR handling, and issue tracking
2. **Docker MCP Server** - For container management and Docker operations
3. **Git MCP Server** - For local Git operations
4. **Memory MCP Server** - For persistent memory across sessions
5. **Filesystem MCP Server** - For secure file operations

### Qwen 3 Integration

- Qwen 3 offers Mixture of Experts (MoE) models with efficient resource allocation
- Qwen 3 supports hybrid thinking modes for dynamic computational resource allocation
- The Qwen-Agent framework provides native support for MCP
- Integration can be achieved through direct API, OpenAI-compatible API, or Qwen-Agent framework

### Implementation Strategy

- Enhance MCP server management with discovery, installation, configuration, and health monitoring
- Implement Qwen integration using the Qwen-Agent framework
- Create a hierarchical agent system with specialized agents for different tasks
- Enhance the user interface with a chat panel and improved server management UI

## Next Steps

1. **Implement MCP Server Management Enhancements**
   - Server discovery and installation
   - Server configuration management
   - Server health monitoring
   - Server management UI

2. **Implement Qwen Integration**
   - Qwen API client
   - MCP-Qwen bridge
   - Hierarchical agent system
   - Chat interface

3. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Write unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Refine the user interface
   - Update documentation
