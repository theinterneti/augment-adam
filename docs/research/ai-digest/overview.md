# AI Digest: Syntactic and Semantic Control of LLMs via Sequential Monte Carlo

## Overview

This digest summarizes the key ideas, methods, and implementation notes from the ICLR 2025 paper on using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for controlled generation from large language models (LLMs). It is structured for AI systems and developers, with links to code and further documentation.

- See concepts.md for definitions and core ideas
- See algorithms.md for SMC and related methods
- See domains.md for domain-specific applications
- See implementation.md for code linkage and best practices
- See references.md for further reading
- See tags.md for code/documentation linkage
